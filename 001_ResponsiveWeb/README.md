# FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design

Free Code Camp's Responsive Web Design Curriculum

## Modules
Each nodule is in their own folder with **ALL** steps included. any code that has been has been commented out rather than removed.
This means the files are somewhat clogged with comments, but it allows for me to be able to 'look back' on what I've done whilst learning.
